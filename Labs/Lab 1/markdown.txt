The first step was to copy the contents of the array to a Hashmap
The key for the hashmap would be the integer value
The value is the index of that integer in the array

The second step is to iterate through the keys of the hashmap
If the target number minus the key (integer value) exists as a key different to the current key, 
that means that there exists a number in the array that equals the target when added to the key

At that point we can simply return the values (indexes) of the two keys found
If no key-pairs are found that add up to the target, we state that no solution was found
