First, we compare the lengths of strings s and t. If they are not equal, return false.

To determine if two strings are anagrams, the code creates hashmaps for each string.
The key is a character and value is an int that stores how many times that character appears. 

Let's call them sMap and tMap for strings s and t respectively. 

We then iterate through every character in string s. 
If we see a character that's not in sMap, we add it with a value of 1.
If the character is already in sMap, we increment the value of the key by 1.
Because we already checked to see if the lengths are equal, we can do the same for t & tMap in the same loop.

Then we simply return whether or not sMap and tMap are equal.
