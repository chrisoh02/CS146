1. 10000000000n^2 vs n^3
n^3 is greater 

Cubic functions grow faster than quadratic functions, regardless of the co-efficient



2. (n^2)log(n) vs n(log(n))^10
(n^2)log(n) is greater

We can divide both sides by nlog(n) to simply the comparison to n vs log(n)^9

Let's say that f(n) = log(n)^9 and g(n) = n
If g(n) is asymptotically greater than f(n), then the limit f(n)/g(n) = 0 as n approaches infinity.
Because f(n) and g(n) both approach postive infinity as n approaches infinity, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule.

To make future calculations easier, we will rewrite f(n) as (ln(n)^9)/(ln(2)^9), and as we're dealing with limits, we can ignore the denominator because it is a constant.
So we will say that f(n) = ln(n)^9 for future purposes.

f'(n) = (9ln(n)^8 )/n and g'(n) = 1, which means that f'(n)/g'(n) = f'(n)
Note that both f(n)/g(n) and f'(n)/g'(n) have n as the denominator. 
This means that we can follow the same steps. This time let's say that f(n) = 9ln(n)^8 and that g(n) = n. We will also ignore the co-efficient in f(n) and say that it is ln(n)^8.
L'Hôpital's rule still applies, so we can repeat the same logic by inductive reasoning.
This simplifies until the limit = 1/n.
The limit of 1/n as n approaches infinity equals 0.
Thus g(n) must be asymptotically greater than f(n).



3. n^log(n) vs 2^sqrt(n)
2^sqrt(n) is greater

Take log base 2 of both sides, such that log(n^log(n)) vs log(2^sqrt(n))
This simplifies to log(n)^2 vs sqrt(n)
We can square both sides such that (log(n)^2))^2 vs (sqrt(n))^2
This simplifies to log(n)^4 vs n

We can use the same reasoning that we used in problem 2.
The only difference is that f(n) = log(n)^4 instead of log(n)^9, but note that in our solution f(n) = log(n)^4 would've been a step while solving problem 2.
We can say that n is greater than log(n)^9 as n approaches infinity.


4. 2^n vs 2^(2n)
2^(2n) is greater

We can take the log base 2 of both sides: log(2^n) vs log(2^(2n)) to get n vs 2n
2n is asymptotically greater than n
