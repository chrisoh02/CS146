Step one is to create a Hashset that will hold all the triples
A Hashset will prevent duplicate triplets from being added
This will later be converted to a List to fit the criteria

Next, sort the array, this will allow for binary search later on

Create a nested for loop like so:
for (i = 0; i <  num.length - 1; i++):
  for (int j = 0; j < num.length - 2; j++):

i and j will be all the unique index pairs from nums[]

Find the remaining value that will complete the triplet 
int third = -(nums[i] + nums[j])

Use binary search to find if that third value exists within the array between indices j + 1 to the end of the array

If that value does exist, add the triple to the Hashset (hashset prevents duplicate triplets)

Add all of the triplets from the Hashset to the List of triplets and return
