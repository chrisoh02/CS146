Step one is to create a Hashset that will hold all the triples
A Hashset will prevent duplicate triplets from being added
This will later be converted to a List to fit the criteria

Next, sort the array, this will allow for binary search later on

Create a nested for loop like so:
for (i = 0; i <  num.length - 1; i++):
  for (int j = 0; j < num.length - 2; j++):

i and j will be all the unique index pairs from nums[]
