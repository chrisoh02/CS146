Problem: optimize water distribution in a village

The basic idea is to create a minimum spanning tree for our village.

However, we can't just do a MST because the houses can also have wells. These wells might be cheaper than adding a pipe.

We can treat the cost of a well for each house as an edge. We create a dummy edge that connects to every single house. 
The weight of the edge is the cost of the well.

From there we can simply run Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST and then return the total cost.
