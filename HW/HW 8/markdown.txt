We will have a HashMap called "freq" that keeps track of how many times a character appears in a string
We will keep the length of the palindrome under the variable "length"

In a for loop that iterates through every character in the string

If our Hashmap already contains that character, we increment the character's count by 1
  If that character has appeared an even amount of times, we know that it can appear twice in our palindrome, so increment length by 2
  We then set the character's count to 0

If our Hashmap doesn't already contain the character, we add the character to the map with a count of 1

After we exit the loop, we check our map to see if there is any character with a count of 1
If there is, that means we can place that character at the center of our palindrome, so we increment length by 1

Return length
