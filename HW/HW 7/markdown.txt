We will keep a list of rooms
Each room is a list that holds intervals such that none overlap
For example, room 1 = [[0,1][1,2][4,7]]
Each room will be sorted (no need to actually sort it, the way the intervals will be added will keep it sorted)
This list is initalized with one empty room

For each interval, loop through every existing room
If the room is empty, add the interval
If the interval ends before the first meeting add the interval to the very beginning
If the interval fits inbetween 2 existing meetings, then add that meeting inbetween them
If the interval starts after the last meeting ends, add the meeting to the end
If none of these criteria were met, make a new room, add the interval to that room and add that room to the list.

Return the number of rooms in the list.
