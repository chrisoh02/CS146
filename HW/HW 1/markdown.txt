Java Explanation
Create an empty string called filtered to store only the alphanumeric characters
Iterate through each character of String s

if the character is a lowercase letter or a number, add it to filtered
else if the character is an uppercase letter add the lowercase version of it to filtered

Then iterate halfway through the filtered string
Compare each character with the equidistant character from the other end
ex) compare the 1st character to the last character, compare the 2nd character to the 2nd to last character
if any don't match, break and return false

Python Explanation
Same concept but with library
Set the input string to lowercase
Then use Python's regular expressions to remove all characters that aren't in 'a'-'z' or '0'-'9'
Create another string which is the new filtered string backwards
return if the two strings match
